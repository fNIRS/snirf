# Shared Near Infrared Spectroscopy Format (SNIRF)

This repository stores the Shared Near Infrared Spectroscopy Format (SNIRF).  
SNIRF is designed by the community in an effort to facilitate sharing and analysis of NIRS data.

View the most recent release version of the format: [here](https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf/blob/v1.1/snirf_specification.md).  
View the development version of the format: [here](snirf_specification.md).   


## Validating SNIRF files

[pysnirf2](https://pypi.org/project/pysnirf2/) is the currently actively maintained tool for reading, writing and validating SNIRF files. pysnirf2 can be easily installed in a Python 3 environment using pip.

See the [pysnirf2 README](https://github.com/BUNPC/pysnirf2#validating-a-snirf-file) for usage examples.

## Development Information

Please read the procedure for [making contributions to SNIRF](CONTRIBUTING.md).

To download the latest specification document alone click on this
[download link](https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf/archive/master.zip),
or use the below command
```
   git clone https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf.git
```

You may optionally download the sample data, or a parser that you need. To do so, you need
to first `cd` the folder where the snirf repository was cloned, and then run the below commands
```
   cd snirf                                # cd the folder where the repo was cloned
   git submodule update samples            # checkout the sample data files (needs >240MB)
   git submodule update lib/matlab/easyh5  # checkout a specific matlab parsers, or
   git submodule update --init --remote    # checkout all components
```

To download the entire package at once, including the latest specification document, 
sample files and all currently supported parsers, you should use the below command
```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf.git
```


### Sample files and parsers

The latest versions of the individual submodules, including sample data and parsers, can also 
be downloaded by clicking on the the below links. After download, please follow the README
file in each package for instructions on how to use.
