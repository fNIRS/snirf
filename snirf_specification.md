Rewrite 
Shared Near Infrared File Format Specification
============================================================

### License: This document is in the public domain.

The file format specification uses the extension \*.snirf.  These are HDF5 format files, renamed with the .snirf extension.  For a program to be “SNIRF-compliant”, it must be able to read and write the SNIRF file.  

The HDF5 specificiations are defined by the HDF5 group and found at https://www.hdfgroup.org.  At this time, the current version of the specificiations is version 1.10 (Feburary 2019) as the basis for the SNIRF format.  It is expected that HDF5 future versions will remain backwards compatibility in the foreseeable future.

The HDF5 format defines "groups" (H5G class) and "datasets" (H5D class) that are the two primary data organization and storage classes used in the SNIRF specificiation. 


The structure of each data file has a minimum of required elements noted below. For each element in the data structure, one of the 4 types is assigned, including

- `group`: a structure containing sub-fields  (defined in the H5G object class).  Arrays of groups are denoted with numbers at the end (e.g. /nirs/data1, /nirs/data2) starting with index 1.  Array indices should be contiguious with no skipped values (although an empty group with no sub-members can be used to "zero out" an entry).

- `string`: either ASCII encoded 8bit CHAR array or UNICODE UTF-16 array.   Defined by the H5T.NATIVE_CHAR or
H5T.H5T_NATIVE_B16 datatypes in H5T.  (note, at this time HDF5 does not have a UTF16 native type, so 
H5T_NATIVE_B16 will need to be converted to/from unicode-16 within the read/write code).  

- `integer`: the native integer types H5T.NATIVE_INT H5T datatype (alias of H5T_STD_I32BE or H5T_STD_I32LE)

- `numeric`: one of the native double or floating-point types; H5T.NATIVE_DOUBLE or H5T.NATIVE_FLOAT in H5T. (alias of H5T_IEEE_F64BE,H5T_IEEE_F64LE [double] or H5T_IEEE_F32BE, H5T_IEEE_F32LE [float])    		   

For `integer` and `numeric` data fields, users should use HDF5's Datatype Interface to query the byte-length stored in the file.

Note, native datatypes are defined by the build of the software (e.g. little/big endian) and are autmatically converted by the HDF5 backend for consistent read/write between OS platforms.

## SNIRF file specification

The SNIRF data format must have the initial H5G group type "/nirs" at the initial file location.


### Required fields 
<dl>
<h3> /formatVersion [Required]</h3>
<dt>formatVersion</dt><tt>[Type: string] [Location: /formatVersion ]</tt>
<dd>This is a string that specifies the version of the file format.  This document describes format version “1.0”</dd>
	
<h3> /nirs{0} [Required]</h3>
<dt>nirs{0}</dt><tt>[Type: indexed group] [Location: /nirs{0} where {0} is the array index] </tt>
<dd> This group stores one set of NIRS data.  This can be extended adding the count number (e.g. nirs1, nirs2,...) to the group name. This is intended to allow the storage of 1 or more complete NIRS datasets inside the single SNIRF format.  For example, two-person hyperscanning can be stored using the notation
	/nirs1 =  first subject's data
	/nirs2 =  second subject's data
The use of a non-indexed (e.g. /nirs/) entry is allowed when only one entry is present and is assumed to be entry 1. 	
</dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0} [Required]</h3>
<dt>data{0}</dt><tt>[Type: indexed group] [Location: /nirs/data{0} where {0} is the array index]</tt>
<dd> This group stores one block of NIRS data.  This can be extended adding the count number (e.g. data1, data2,...) to the group name.  This is intended to allow the storage of 1 or more blocks of NIRS data from within the same /nirs entry
	/nirs/data1 =  block 1
	/nirs/data2 =  block 2	
</dd>
	
<h3> /nirs/data{0}/dataTimeSeries [Required] </h3>	
<dt>data{0}.dataTimeSeries</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 2D-array] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/dataTimeSeries] </tt>
<dd>This is the actual raw or processed data variable. This variable has dimensions of <tt>&lt;number of time points&gt; x &lt;number of channels&gt;</tt>. Columns in <i>dataTimeSeries</i> are mapped to the measurement list (<i>measurementList</i> variable described below).  

dataTimeSeries can be compressed using the Hdf5 filter (prebuilt filters 305-LZO or 307-bzip2 supported; see https://support.hdfgroup.org/services/filters.html).  

Chunked data is allowed to support real-time streaming of data in this array. </dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/time [Required] </h3>	
<dt>data{0}.time</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 1D array] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/time]</tt>
<dd>The <i>time</i> variable. This provides the acquisition time of the measurement relative to the time origin.  This will usually be a straight line with slope equal to the acquisition frequency, but does not need to be equal spacing.  For the special case of equal sample spacing a shorthand <2x1> array is allowed where the first entry is the start time and the 
second entry is the sample time spacing in seconds (e.g. 0.2 = 200ms [equivelent to 5Hz]) 
		
	Option1 - The size of this variable is <number of time points x 1> and 
	corresponds to the sample time of every data point
	
	Option2-  The size of this variable is <2x1> and correponds to the start
	time and sample spacing.

Chunked data is allowed to support real-time streaming of data in this array.  </dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0} [Required] </h3>	
<dt>./data{0}.measurementList{0}</dt><tt>[Type: indexed group] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0} ]</tt>
<dd>The measurement list. This variable serves to map the data array onto the probe geometry (sources and detectors), data type, and wavelength. This variable is an array structure that has the size <tt>&lt;number of channels&gt;</tt> that describes the corresponding column in the data matrix. For example, the *measurementList(3)* describes the third column of the data matrix (i.e. *dataTimeSeries(:,3)*).

Each element of the array is a structure which describes the measurement conditions for this data with the following fields:
</dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/sourceIndex [Required] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.sourceIndex</dt><tt>[Type: integer] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/sourceIndex]</tt>
<dd>Index (starting from 1) of the source.</dd>
	
<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/detectorIndex [Required] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.detectorIndex</dt><tt>[Type: integer] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/detectorIndex]</tt>
<dd>Index (starting from 1) of the detector.</dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/wavelengthIndex [Required] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.wavelengthIndex </dt><tt>[Type: integer] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/wavelengthIndex]</tt>
<dd>Index (starting from 1) of the wavelength.</dd>
	
<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/dataType [Required] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.dataType </dt><tt>[Type: integer] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/dataType]</tt>
<dd>Data-type identifier. See Appendix for list possible values.</dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/dataTypeLabel [Optional] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.dataTypeLabel </dt><tt>[Type: string] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/dataTypeLabel]</tt>
<dd>Data-type label only required if dataType is "processed". See Appendix for list of possible values.</dd>

<h3> /nirs/measurementList{0}/dataTypeIndex [Required] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.dataTypeIndex </dt><tt>[Type: integer] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/dataTypeIndex]</tt>
<dd>Data-type specific parameter indices. One use of this parameter is as a stimulus condition index when measurementList{0}.dataType = Processed and measurementList{0}.dataTypeLabel = 'HRF ...' .</dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/sourcePower [Optional] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.sourcePower </dt><tt>[Type: numeric] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/sourcePower]</tt>
<dd>Source power in milliwatt (mW). </dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/detectorGain [Optional] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.detectorGain </dt><tt>[Type: numeric] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/detectorGain]</tt>
<dd>Detector gain</dd>

<h3> /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/moduleIndex [Optional] </h3>	
<dt> ./measurementList{0}.moduleIndex </dt><tt>[Type: integer] [Location: /nirs/data{0}/measurementList{0}/moduleIndex]</tt>
<dd>Index (starting from 1) of a repeating module. 
			
For example, if *measurementList{5}* is a structure with *sourceIndex=2*, *detectorIndex=3*, *wavelengthIndex=1*, *dataType=1*, *dataTypeIndex=1* would imply that the data in the 5th column of the *dataTimeSeries* variable was measured with source #2 and detector #3 at wavelength #1.  Wavelengths (in nanometers) are described in the *probe.wavelengths* variable  (described later). The data type in this case is 1, implying that it was a continuous wave measurement.  The complete list of currently supported data types is found in the Appendix. The data type index specifies additional data type specific parameters that are further elaborated by other fields in the *probe* structure, as detailed below. Note that the Time Domain and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy data types have two additional parameters and so the data type index must be a vector with 2 elements that index the additional parameters.

*sourcePower* provides the option for information about the source power for that channel to be saved along with the data. The units are not defined, unless the user takes the option of using a *metaDataTag* described below to define, for instance, *sourcePowerUnit*. *detectorGain* provides the option for information about the detector gain for that channel to be saved along with the data.

Note:  The source indices generally refer to the optode naming (probe positions) and not necessarily the physical laser numbers on the instrument. The same is true for the detector indices.  Each source optode would generally, but not necessarily, have 2 or more wavelengths (hence lasers) plugged into it in order to calculate deoxy- and oxy-hemoglobin concentrations. The data from 
these two wavelengths will be indexed by the same source, detector, and data type values, but have different wavelength indices. Using the same source index for lasers at the same location but with different wavelengths simplifies the bookkeeping for converting intensity measurements into concentration changes. As described below, optional variables *probe.sourceLabels* and *probe.detectorLabels* are provided for indicating the instrument specific label for sources and detectors.</dd>

<h3>/nirs/stim{0} [Optional]</h3>
<dt>./stim</dt><tt>[Type: indexed group]</tt>
<dd>This is an array describing any stimulus conditions. Each element of the array has the following required fields.</dd>

<dt>./stim{0}.name</dt><tt>[Type: string] [Location:/nirs/stim{0}/name]</tt>
<dd>This is a string describing the n<sup>th</sup> stimulus condition.</dd>


<h3>/nirs/stim{0}/data [Required as part of stim{0}] </h3>
<dt>./stim(n).data</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 2D array] [Location:/nirs/stim{0}/data]</tt>
<dd> This is a three-column array specifying the stimulus time course for the n<sup>th</sup> condition. Each row corresponds with a specific stimulus trial. The three columns indicate [starttime duration value].  The starttime, in seconds, is the time relative to the time origin when the stimulus takes on a value; the duration is the time in seconds that the stimulus value continues, and value is the stimulus amplitude.  The number of rows is not constrained. (see examples in the appendix).</dd>


<h3>/nirs/probe [Required] </h3>
<dt>./probe</dt><tt>[Type: group] [Location: /nirs/probe ]</tt>
<dd>This is a structured variable that describes the probe (source-detector) geometry.  This variable has a number of required fields.</dd>

<h3>/nirs/probe/wavelengths [Required] </h3>
<dt>./probe.wavelengths</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 1D array] [Location: /nirs/probe/wavelengths]</tt>
<dd>This field describes the wavelengths used.  This is indexed by the wavelength index of the measurementList variable. For example, *probe.wavelengths* = [690 780 830]; implies that the measurements were taken at three wavelengths (690nm, 780nm, and 830nm).  The wavelength index of *measurementList(k).wavelengthIndex* variable refers to this field.  *measurementList(k).wavelengthIndex* = 2 means the k<sup>th</sup> measurement was at 780nm.

The number of wavelengths is not limited (except that at least two are needed to calculate the two forms of hemoglobin).  Each source-detector pair would generally have measurements at all wavelengths.
</dd>


<h3>/nirs/probe/wavelengthsEmission [Optional] </h3>
<dt>./probe.wavelengthsEmission</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 1D array]</tt>
<dd>This field is required only for fluorescence data types, and describes the emission wavelengths used.  The indexing of this variable is the same wavelength index in measurementList used for <i>probe.wavelengths</i> such that the excitation wavelength 
is paired with this emission wavelength for a given measurement.</dd>

<dt>./probe.sourcePos</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 2D array] [Location: /nirs/probe/sourcePos] </tt>
<dd>This field describes the position (in spatialUnit units) of each source optode.  This field has size <tt>&lt;number of sources&gt; x 3</tt>. For example, <i>probe.sourcePos(1,:)</i> = [1.4 1 0], and <i>SpatialUnit='cm'</i>; places source 
number 1 at x=1.4 cm and y=1 cm and z=0 cm.

<h3>/nirs/probe/landmarkPos3D [Optional] </h3>
<dt>./probe.landmarkPos3D</dt><tt>[Type: numeric 2D array] [Location: /nirs/probe.landmarkPos3D] </tt>
<dd>This is a 2-D array storing the neurological landmark positions measurement from 3-D digitization and tracking systems to facilitate the registration and mapping of optical data to brain anatomy. This array should contain a minimum of 3 columns, representing the x, y and z coordinates of the digitized landmark positions.

<h3>/nirs/metaDataTags{0} [Required] </h3>
<dt>./metaDataTags{0}</dt><tt>[Type: indexed group] [Location: /nirs/metaDataTags]</tt>

[key: 'SubjectName',          value: 'Pseudonym, I.M.A.'],
[key: 'DateOfBirth',          value: '20120401'],
[key: 'AcquisitionStartTime', value: '150127.34']
[key: 'StudyID',              value: 'Infant Brain Development']
[key: 'StudyDescription',     value: 'We study infant cognitive development.']
[key: 'AccessionNumber',      value: 'INA2S12']
[key: 'InstanceNumber',       value: '2']

```

The following metadata tags are required:

```
SubjectID
MeasurementDate
MeasurementTime
SpatialUnit    (allowed values are 'mm' and 'cm')
```

The metadata tags "StudyID" and "AccessionNumber" are unique strings that can be used to link the current dataset to a particular study and a particular procedure, respectively. The "StudyID" tag is similar to the DICOM tag "Study ID" (0020,0010) and "AccessionNumber" is similar to the DICOM tag "Accession Number"(0008,0050), as defined in the DICOM standard (ISO 12052).

The metadata tag "InstanceNumber" is defined similarly to the DICOM tag "Instance Number" (0020,0013), and can be used as the sequence number to group multiple datasets into a larger dataset - for example, concatenating streamed data segments during a long measurement session.</dd>	
	
Each element of <i>metaDataTags</i> has the following required fields:</dd>
	
<h3>/nirs/metaDataTags{0}/key [Required] </h3>
<dt>./metaDataTags{0}.key</dt><tt>[Type: string] [Location: /nirs/metaDataTags{0}/key]</tt>

<dt>./metaDataTags(n).value</dt><tt>[Type: string] [Location: /nirs/metaDataTags{0}/value]</tt>
<dd>This is a string value of the metadata tag. All values will be stored as strings. How strings are converted into numeric values is left to whoever defines the key.  However, it is required that dates be stored as YYYYMMDD, and clock times be stored as 
HHMMSS.SSSS… (24 hour format) for consistency.  Time intervals must be in seconds.</dd>

The size of this variable is <tt>&lt;number of time points&gt; x 1</tt> or <2x1> similar to definition of the /nirs/data/time field.

Chunked data is allowed to support real-time data streaming</dd>

<h3>/nirs/aux{0}/timeOffset [Optional] </h3>
<dt>./aux{0}.timeOffset</dt><tt>[Type: numeric]
